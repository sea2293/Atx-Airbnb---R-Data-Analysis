Project goal: Provide analytic insight on on ATX Airbnb data. 

Questions to answer: How big is my dataset? What do the top 10 items of data look like? What is the distribution of my variables of interest (mean/median, skew, outliers)? How does data change over time? What is the relationship between Variable A and Variable B? Why does Variable A behave in such and such a manner?

Inspiration
What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
Which hosts are the busiest and why?
Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?
